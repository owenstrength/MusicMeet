## How it Works

Music Meet's matching algorithm uses word2vec in JavaScript to analyze your music listening data. Here's how it works:

1. **Data Collection**: Music Meet securely collects your music listening data, including your favorite artists, genres, and tracks.

2. **Word2Vec Analysis**: The app employs word2vec, a natural language processing technique, to vectorize your music preferences. This converts your listening data into a numerical representation.

3. **Matching**: The algorithm compares your vectorized data with other users' data and identifies users with the most similar vectors, indicating a strong overlap in music preferences.

4. **Recommendations**: Music Meet displays users with similar music tastes, ranked by compatibility, allowing you to connect with those who share your passion for music.
